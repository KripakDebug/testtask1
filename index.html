					<h2>Dubliner Irish Bar</h2>
					<p><b>Location:</b> Tyn 1, Old Town, Prague 1</p>
					<p>
						The Dubliner Irish Bar in Prague has everything a good Irish pub
						should: lively music, great atmosphere and fine beers. This warm,
						welcoming pub is also a sports bar, with 2 large screens and 14 TV's
						showing Premiership and International football, plus American NFL
						football. Ideal for the big match, and Prague stag nights and hen
						parties on a pub crawl.

					<h2>Rocky O'Reillys Irish Bar</h2>
					<p><b>Location:</b> Stepanska 32, New Town, Prague 1</p>
					<p>
						Rocky O’Reillys offers a taste of Ireland in the centre of Prague,
						with friendly Irish hospitality, and Guinness and Kilkenny on tap. A
						projection screen and TVs show live sports, the sounds of which are
						often drowned out by the lively tunes. The bar is popular with
						groups, evident by the fact that some stag parties don't seem to
						leave for the whole weekend!

					<h2>McCarthy's Irish Pub & Disco</h2>
					<p><b>Location:</b> Rytirska 10, Old Town, Prague 1</p>
					<p>
						Well situated between the Old Town Square and Wenceslas Square,
						McCarthy's has the aged Irish pub feel off to a tee. It offers an
						alluring mix of satisfying drinks, lively atmosphere and big screen

					<p>
						A little piece of Ireland in a quiet corner of Prague, just five
						minutes walk from the Old Town Square. James Joyce is a traditional
						Irish pub with a casual atmosphere, offering a warm and hearty
						welcome, and some of the freshest Guinness in Prague. There is TV
						coverage of major sports occasions, in a calmer setting than other
						sports bars in Prague.
